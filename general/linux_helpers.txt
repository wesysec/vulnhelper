# These are linux helpers to compliment tools found in Kali Linux

Recently I got back into vulnhub challenges and started with NullByte-1.  I was trying to use patator to perform a dictionary 
attack on the web form but found that there were encoding challenges when using the builtin wordlists like big.txt or 
rockyou.txt.  I was seeing errors like "'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xf3 in position 4382: invalid continuation byte" 
when using the following command:

patator http_fuzz url=http://192.168.57.12/kzMb5nVYJw/index.php method=POST body='key=FILE0' 0=/usr/share/dirb/wordlists/big.txt follow=1 accept_cookie=1 -x ignore:fgrep='invalid key' -x quit:fgrep!='invalid key'

After some research I found that these files contained non-standard ascii characters and instead of changing the tool I 
figured it would be faster to find and remove the bad characters.  The two native linux commands below helped me to 
quickly get up and running with patator.

Find non-ascii characters in file:
grep --color='auto' -P -n "[\x80-\xFF]" file

Remove non-ascii character in file:
tr -dc '\0-\177' < file > newfile
If error:
LC_ALL=C tr -dc '\0-\177' < file > newfile
